### Repository Contents:

- Readme.md - You're here
- /qgis_plugin/tuflow - contains the main core of the plugin.

- /utilities/ - location for functionality / libraries that can be re-used elsewhere (e.g. a python lib that's also a script).

### QGIS Version

  These plugins are currently only available for QGIS 2.0 and above.  We are no longer supporting a TUFLOW plugin for 1.8. As part of the QGIS install python should already be installed on your machine.


### To install:  

  To enable please save the .zip file to your QGIS plugin directory and then unzip.  This zip folder will contain a number folders as outlined above.

The tuflow folder from QGIS-TUFLOW-Plugin-master.zip\QGIS-TUFLOW-Plugin-master\qgis_plugin\tuflow should sit directly plugin folder i.e.

	C:\Users\<username>\.qgis2\python\plugins\tuflow\


Alternatively you can clone the repository from github, although you will need to unpack into the directory structure above.

## TUFLOW Directory Structure Settings

Allows some customisation of the default TUFLOW directory structure.

### Extension Mappings Table

Associate file extensions with a "key" that is used as a lookup in the **Folder Structure** table. Some files are hard-locked to a specific key, e.g. "bc\_dbase.csv" is locked to the "bc\_dbase" key and does not use the ".csv" extension.

### Folder Structure Table

Associate a "key" with a directory location. If the checkbox is ticked, the directory will always be created even if it ends up being empty.

<h2>TUFLOW Directory Structure Settings</h2>

<p>Allows some customisation of the default TUFLOW directory structure.</p>

<h3>Extension Mappings Table</h3>

<p>Associate file extensions with a "key" that is used as a lookup in the <strong>Folder Structure</strong> table. Some files are hard-locked to a specific key, e.g. "bc_dbase.csv" is locked to the "bc_dbase" key and does not use the ".csv" extension.</p>

<h3>Folder Structure Table</h3>

<p>Associate a "key" with a directory location. If the checkbox is ticked, the directory will always be created even if it ends up being empty.</p>

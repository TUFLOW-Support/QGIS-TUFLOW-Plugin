<p>This tool creates a conduit extension to eliminate the SWMM error with multiple links connected to the same outfall node. This is a common issue when converting from other models. Dummy channels are used for the extensions which will route the flows without any additional losses.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>This tool starts with a GeoPackage file and create a new GeoPackage file that contains the channel extensions.</p>

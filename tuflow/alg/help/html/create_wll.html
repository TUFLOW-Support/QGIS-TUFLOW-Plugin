<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Utility to automatically create TUFLOW WLLs.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>1D Network Channel Layer</strong>: The layer that will have water level lines created for it. WLL will be created perpendicular to the lines in this layer. This layer does not need to be a 1d_nwk layer, however if it is, 'X' type channels will be ignored.</li>
<li><strong>WLL Line Length</strong>: The length of the WLL lines to be created (in map units).</li>
<li><strong>WLL Max Spacing</strong>: The maximum spacing between WLL lines (in map units).</li>
<li><strong>WLL Spacing Calculation Method</strong>: The method used to calculate the spacing between WLL Lines (note, a WLL will always be created at channel ends)
<ol>
<li><strong>Fixed Spacing Along Channel Length</strong>: WLLs will be placed at exactly the <strong>WLL Max Spacing</strong> along each channel</li>
<li><strong>Equal Spacing Along Channel Length</strong>: WLLs will be placed at equal intervals along each channel. The number of WLLs will be calculated based on the <strong>WLL Max Spacing</strong> and the channel length. Note, at least one WLL will be created for each channel.</li>
<li><strong>Equal Spacing Along Channel Segment</strong>: WLLs will be placed at equal intervals along each channel segment (i.e. between internal vertices). The number of WLLs will be calculated based on the <strong>WLL Max Spacing</strong> and the segment length. Note, at least one WLL will be created for each segment only if <strong>Always Add WLL at Vertices</strong> is not checked.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Always Add WLL at Vertices</strong>: If checked, a WLL will be added at each internal vertex of the channel layer.</li>
<li><strong>Clip WLLs to Layer</strong>: If checked, WLLs will be clipped to the boundary of the polygon layer specified in <strong>Clip Layer</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Clip Layer</strong>: The polygon layer to clip WLLs to. Only applicable if <strong>Clip WLLs to Layer</strong> is checked.</li>
<li><strong>WLL Thinning Options</strong>: Options to thin/filter resulting WLLs
<ol>
<li><strong>No Thinning</strong>: No thinning will be applied to the WLLs</li>
<li><strong>Remove Overlapping WLLs</strong>: Any WLLs that overlap will be removed (note, removal will be based on processing order, with later WLLs removed if intersecting earlier created WLLs)</li>
<li><strong>Remove Overlapping WLLs and WLLs close to Vertices</strong>: Remove overlapping WLLs (same as <strong>Remove Overlapping WLLs</strong>) and will also remove WLLs that are within 20% of the <strong>WLL Max Spacing</strong> of an end or mid vertex.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

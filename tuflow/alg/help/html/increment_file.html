<h2>Increment File</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Increments a given layer by saving the old layer as a new layer with a new name (usually by incrementing the run number in the layer name). In this case the layer is either a SHP or MIF file so the entire file will be incremented. The open layer in QGIS will have its datasource replaced by the new layer.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Output Folder</strong>: The location of the output folder. This is where the new layer will be saved to (usually the same directory as the old layer).</li>
<li><strong>Output Name</strong>: The name of the new layer. This name will automatically be incremented by 1 (e.g. <code>2d_zsh_001</code> will become <code>2d_zsh_002</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Remove Old Layer</strong>: If checked, will not retain the old layer in the QGIS workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Old Layer</strong>: If checked, will retain the old layer in the QGIS workspace.</li>
</ol>

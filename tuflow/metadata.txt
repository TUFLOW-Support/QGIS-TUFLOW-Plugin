# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog entries:
changelog=Added 1D Integrity Tool
          Added REFH2 Tool
          TUFLOW Viewer now supports user enabled resizing of some of the internal widgets
          Loading results from .tlf now supported - currently only works for .xmdf map outputs
          Map tool prior drawing map plot lines or points is now restored on completion of map plotting
          Flux plotting calculation speed has been increased
          Flux plotting progress bar is now more robust for large calculations and has been moved to TUFLOW Viewer widget
          TUFLOW Viewer can now be reloaded - useful if you get a python error and need to reset the viewer without restarting QGIS
          ARR2016 has been renamed ARR2019
          ARR2019 to TUFLOW tool now supports ARF for Events less than 50% AEP
          ARR2019 to TUFLOW tool now supports impervious rainfall losses for auto output
          ARR2019 to TUFLOW tool now supports user applied area directly in the dialog
          ARR2019 to TUFLOW tool will now linearly interpolate initial losses for 0.5EY and 0.2EY events
          ARR2019 fixed bug when reading in a blank argument e.g. blank name field - this could occur if input gis wasn't a shape file
          Fixed bug in ARR2019 to TUFLOW tool where output graph for IL legend did not match plotted lines
          Fixed bug in ARR2019 when saving static / Hill et all value to qsettings
          ARR2019 to TUFLOW now reprojects layer to long/lat and writes to memory and no longer leaves any _reproject.shp in output folder
          Fixed bug in ARR2019 tool where changing GIS layer while using manual area selection would cause python error
          Fixed issue when show current time was selected when viewing FV results
          Animations for FV results now supported
          Animations using datetime on the X-axis now supported
          FV results working in export map tool
          Datetime supported in map export tool
          Non-loaded results now supported in export map tool
          Fixed bugs for plots in map export tool
          Datetime supported when displaying 'time' for animations
          Fixed bug when rounding timesteps would result in formatted times that didn't make sense
          Hashtag now supported as comment character in load from TCF tool
          Fixed bug in load from TCF tool where it would skip 'else' blocks
          Filtering and sorting layers tool is now case insensitive when it sorts
          Filtering and sorting layers now removes duplicate layers when possible
          Fixed bug with map plotting after saving project - it would refresh everytime the map window was refreshed
          Fixed bug when selecting 'max' or 'secondary axis' after clicking draw cross section would cause NULL geometry error
          Increased animation plot limits to a more appropriate value
          Fixed bug when reading in TUFLOW FV results where the viewer would interpret as 'special times' due to the units
          Batch export map tool now supports using active dataset on plot i.e. plot can change based on mapped surface
          Export to csv and copy data to clipboard now removes duplicate time and chainage columns
          User can now import map table from a external file for batch export map tool
          Final Minimum dt now treated as 'maximum' and no longer duplicates results in widget e.g. no longer "Minimum dt [1]"
          Result will noe update if user updates zero date
          Fixed bug in Batch Export Plot tool where 2 secondary axes were being exported if secondary axis was being used
          Fixed bug in secondary axis labelling that would label with same as primary axis sometimes
          Fixed bug that would only display map flow from one result even if more than one mesh layer was open
          Fixed bug in import user plot data that was not skipping blank or null value rows
          Animations now supports 1D long plots and 1D time series on same animation
          Fixed bug when plotting long plots in animations and 1D output does not match 2D output timesteps
          Import Empty now prompts user to overwrite if file exists already
          Insert TUFLOW attributes now same as above
          Fixed bug in Insert TUFLOW attributes that would have the wrong display name in QGIS
          Fixed bug when no data was being plotted but the x axis was in dates that would sometimes cause a python error
          Fixed bug when plotting user data that have dates attached - previously tuflow viewer would only use hours to display
          Tuflow viewer can now be forced to redock - useful for when dock sometimes disappear (tends to happen after being stacked with other dock widgets then removed)
          Map plotting selected features now uses feature attribute in labelling
          Structure flows and structure levels now display properly in TS results
